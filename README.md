# Modeling Human Adaptation in a Non-Stationary Two-Armed Bandit Task

This project compares a Basic Rescorla-Wagner model against a Complex Curiosity-Based model to explore how humans rapidly adapt in a non-stationary two-armed bandit task. The complex model tests the hypothesis that humans re-compute the utility of non-chosen actions using knowledge about the environment's hidden structure. Model comparison favors the complex model, suggesting humans leverage counterfactual curiosity for faster adaptation.
